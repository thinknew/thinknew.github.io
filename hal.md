### Human Augmentation Lab (HAL) Launch

The Human Augmentation Lab (HAL) has officially opened at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Tech Lab. The lab focuses on advancing research in brain–computer interfaces (BCI), neuroadaptive systems, human augmentation, and cognitive enhancement technologies designed for real-world applications.

HAL brings together expertise across machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and mixed reality to develop next-generation human–AI systems that enhance cognition, support decision-making, and improve everyday human–technology interaction.

More information about ongoing projects, team members, and research activities will be updated soon.
