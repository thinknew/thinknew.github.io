I am a Senior Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and the Australian AI Institute at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, and Director of the Human Augmentation Lab. My research focuses on brain–computer interfaces (BCI), neuroadaptive systems, and human augmentation, working at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and mixed reality to develop real-world neuroadaptive BCI technologies for cognitive enhancement and decision-making.

I serve as Co-Chair of the IEEE Neuroethics Framework for the Workplace (IEEE Brain), a member of the IEEE Standards Committee on Unifying Brain–Computer Interfaces, and an expert advisor to expert advisor for [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/projects/neurotechnology-and-children) and [The Centre of Neurotechnology and Law, UK](https://www.neurotechlaw.com/ourpanel). I actively engage in transhumanism research and advocacy, and am the founder of the India Future Society, a think tank exploring emerging technologies and long-term human futures.
