I am a Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor) at the School of Computer Science and Australian AI Institute at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. I serve as a co-chair of the IEEE Neuroethics Framework for the Workplace, sponsored by IEEE Brain, a member of the IEEE Standards Committee on Unifying Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), expert advisor on [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/projects/neurotechnology-and-children) and [The Centre of Neurotechnology and Law, UK](https://www.neurotechlaw.com/ourpanel). I actively advocate for and support transhumanism and founded the India Future Society, a think tank.

Working at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive neuroscience, and mixed-reality, I am dedicated to designing and developing real-world neuroadaptive BCI systems. My current research interests include integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with cognitive neuroscience knowledge to explore cognitive functions, discover relationships between brain dynamics, evaluate everyday interactions and make decisions to develop robust next-generation neuroadaptive BCIs.
