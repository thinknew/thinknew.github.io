I am PostDoctotal Research Fellow at the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of Technology Sydney.

The current interests of my research are to integrate the artificial intelligence (Al) technologies with cognitive neuroscience knowledge for exploring the cognitive functions, discovering the relationships between brain dynamics, evaluated everyday interaction, decision making, and develop robust brain computer interface.
